# CargoLoadOptimization
Vision-Based Cargo Load Optimization
Overview
The Vision-Based Cargo Load Optimization project leverages cutting-edge computer vision techniques, particularly YOLOv8, to optimize cargo loading in a way that maximizes space utilization, minimizes human intervention, and improves efficiency in warehouse or transport environments. This system uses real-time images of cargo to analyze and determine the best arrangement for loading cargo into storage spaces or containers.

Features
YOLOv8 Object Detection: Detects and classifies cargo items from images.

Cargo Load Optimization Algorithm: Efficiently calculates the optimal arrangement of cargo to maximize space.

Real-Time Image Processing: Supports real-time processing of images from cameras or video feeds.

Data Integration: Ability to integrate real cargo images from cargodatacorp.com for model training.

User Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for visualization of the cargo arrangement.

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for model implementation and system integration.

YOLOv8: A state-of-the-art object detection model for identifying cargo items.

OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.

TensorFlow / PyTorch: Deep learning libraries used for training and deploying models.

Flask/Django (Optional): For building a web interface.

Docker: For containerizing the application and ensuring portability.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Pip (Python package installer)

Step-by-Step Installation
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-based-cargo-load-optimization.git
cd vision-based-cargo-load-optimization
Create a virtual environment

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download YOLOv8 model weights

Follow instructions on the YOLOv8 GitHub to download pretrained weights or train your own model.

Prepare the dataset

Download real cargo images from cargodatacorp.com for model training.

Place the images in the data/cargo_images folder.

Run the system

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Training the YOLOv8 Model
Prepare your dataset with labeled cargo images. You can use annotation tools like LabelImg or CVAT to label objects in images.

Train the YOLOv8 model on your labeled dataset by running the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py --data data/cargo_data.yaml --cfg yolov8.yaml --weights '' --batch-size 16 --epochs 50
Usage
Load Cargo Image: Upload or capture a cargo image.

Process and Optimize: The system will detect cargo items and generate an optimized loading plan.

View Results: The optimized loading layout is displayed on the interface.
